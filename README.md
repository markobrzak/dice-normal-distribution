# dice-rolls-distribution

## Note 
While rolling dice can resemble normal distribution, which is by definition continous, it is strictly speaking discrete binomial distribution i.e., not continous by definition. It's worth noting that in binomial distribution, as n gets large a [reasonable approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#Normal_approximation) can be given by the normal distribution.
